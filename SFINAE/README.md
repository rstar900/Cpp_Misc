## Substitution Failure Is Not An Error

<br>This is one of the important concepts in Template Meta Programming.
<br>The idea is that the compiler doesn't just give an error at 1st substitution failure, 
<br>it gives an error when it cannot find any suitable substitution for a templated code at all.
